# BFI-2-XS Scoring Methodology

This document explains the scoring methodology for the Big Five Inventory-2-Extra Short Form (BFI-2-XS).

## Overview

The BFI-2-XS is a 15-item personality assessment that measures the Big Five personality traits. Each of the five traits is measured using three items, making it a very brief but still psychometrically sound personality assessment.

## Item Structure

The BFI-2-XS contains 15 items distributed across the five personality domains. The items differ between the Spanish and English versions:

### Spanish Version (SP-BFI-2-XS)

#### Extraversion Items
1. "Que tiende a estar callado/a" (Reverse-scored)
2. "Dominante, que actúa como líder"
3. "Lleno/a de energía"

#### Agreeableness Items
1. "Compasivo/a, con un gran corazón"
2. "Respetuoso/a, que trata a los demás con respeto"
3. "Que piensa bien de la gente"

#### Conscientiousness Items
1. "Formal, constante"
2. "Que mantiene todo limpio y ordenado"
3. "Tenaz, que trabaja hasta terminar la tarea"

#### Negative Emotionality (Neuroticism) Items
1. "Relajado/a, que gestiona bien el estrés" (Reverse-scored)
2. "Emocionalmente estable, que no se altera con facilidad" (Reverse-scored)
3. "Que tiende a sentirse deprimido/a, melancólico/a"

#### Open-Mindedness (Openness) Items
1. "Fascinado/a por el arte, la música o la literatura"
2. "Con poco interés por ideas abstractas" (Reverse-scored)
3. "Original, que aporta ideas nuevas"

### English Version (BFI-2-XS)

1. "Is talkative"
2. "Is reserved" (Reverse-scored)
3. "Is full of energy"

1. "Tends to find fault with others" (Reverse-scored)
2. "Is helpful and unselfish with others"
3. "Starts quarrels with others" (Reverse-scored)

2. "Can be somewhat careless" (Reverse-scored)
3. "Is a reliable worker"

#### Negative Emotionality (Neuroticism) Items

3. "Can be tense"

#### Open-Mindedness (Openness) Items
1. "Is original, comes up with new ideas"
2. "Is curious about many different things"
3. "Is ingenious, a deep thinker"

## Likert Scale

Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale:
1. Disagree strongly
2. Disagree a little
3. Neutral; no opinion
4. Agree a little
5. Agree strongly

## Scoring Procedure

The scoring procedure involves the following steps:

1. **Reverse-Scoring**: Some items are phrased in the opposite direction of the trait they measure. These need to be reverse-scored using the formula:
   ```
   Reversed Score = (Maximum Scale Value + 1) - Original Score
   ```
   For a 5-point Likert scale, this is:
   ```
   Reversed Score = 6 - Original Score
   ```

2. **Trait Calculation**: Scores for each trait are calculated by summing the values of the three items that measure the trait (after any necessary reverse-scoring).

### Specific Reverse-Scoring in the BFI-2-XS

#### Spanish Version (SP-BFI-2-XS)

The following items need to be reverse-scored in the Spanish version:

- Extraversion: Item 1 ("callado" -> outgoing)
- Neuroticism: Items 1 and 2 ("relajado" and "estable" -> anxious and unstable)
- Openness: Item 2 ("abstracto" -> concrete)

#### English Version (BFI-2-XS)

The following items need to be reverse-scored in the English version:

- Extraversion: Item 2 ("reserved" -> outgoing)
- Agreeableness: Items 1 and 3 ("fault" and "quarrels" -> agreeable)
- Conscientiousness: Item 2 ("careless" -> conscientious)
- Neuroticism: Item 2 ("relaxed" -> neurotic)

Note that the structure and arrangement of items differs between the Spanish and English versions, necessitating different scoring approaches for each language version.

## Interpretation

Trait scores can range from 3 to 15, with higher scores indicating a stronger presence of the trait:

- **Low Scores (3-6)**: The trait is weakly present
- **Moderate Scores (7-11)**: The trait is moderately present
- **High Scores (12-15)**: The trait is strongly present

### Domain Interpretations

#### Extraversion
- **High**: Sociable, energetic, assertive, talkative, bold
- **Low**: Reserved, reflective, quiet, private, shy

#### Agreeableness
- **High**: Compassionate, respectful, trusting, humble, patient
- **Low**: Critical, uncooperative, suspicious, competitive, tough

#### Conscientiousness
- **High**: Organized, responsible, diligent, careful, precise
- **Low**: Disorganized, careless, impulsive, spontaneous, flexible

#### Negative Emotionality (Neuroticism)
- **High**: Anxious, moody, self-conscious, sensitive, unstable
- **Low**: Emotionally stable, calm, confident, resilient, optimistic

#### Open-Mindedness (Openness)
- **High**: Creative, intellectual, curious, imaginative, artistic
- **Low**: Practical, conventional, traditional, prefers routine, concrete

## Validity Considerations

When using the BFI-2-XS, consider the following:

1. Being an extra-short form, it sacrifices some reliability and validity for brevity
2. It's best used for quick assessments where time constraints are significant
3. When higher precision is needed, consider using the full BFI-2 (60 items) or BFI-2-S (30 items)
4. Missing data can significantly impact scores due to the small number of items per trait
